# 🏦 Banking System in C++ (CodeAlpha Internship)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **console-based Banking System** developed using **C++** as part of the **CodeAlpha C++ Programming Internship**.
The application demonstrates core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts by simulating real-world banking operations such as account creation, deposits, withdrawals, balance inquiry, and transaction history tracking.
